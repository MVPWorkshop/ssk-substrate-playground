description = """
This pallet provides the basic logic needed to pay the absolute minimum amount needed for a transaction to be included. This includes:
- _base fee_: This is the minimum amount a user pays for a transaction. It is declared as a base _weight_ in the runtime and converted to a fee using `WeightToFee`.
- _weight fee_: A fee proportional to amount of weight a transaction consumes.
- _length fee_: A fee proportional to the encoded length of the transaction.
- _tip_: An optional tip. Tip increases the priority of the transaction, giving it a higher chance to be included by the transaction queue.
The base fee and adjusted weight and length fees constitute the _inclusion fee_, which is the minimum fee for a transaction to be included in a block."""
